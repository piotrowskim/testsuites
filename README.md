# System Applications WG - Testsuites Staging Repository
This is the staging repository for test suites for System Applications WG specs.

Currently available test suites:
--------------------------------
- [app: URI test suite](app-URI/README.md)

Is it an official w3c test suite?
----------------------------------
kinda. We use it internally within a group so we can solve some issues before we push stuff to the official W3C space.

How to contribute?
=============
Everyone is welcome (and encouraged) to contribute to test
development, so long as you fulfill the contribution requirements detailed
in the [Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md). No test is too small or too
simple, especially if it corresponds to something for which you've noted an
interoperability bug in a browser.


W3C test suites:
