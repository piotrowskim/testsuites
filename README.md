Testsuites repository
==========

This is repository for test suites for System Applications WG specs.
We use it internally within a group so we can solve some issues before we push it to w3c test suite.



Currently available test suites:
--------------------------------
- [app-URI test suite](app-URI/README.md)

Is it official w3c test suite?
----------------------------------
Answer: NO

How to contribute?
=============

Every one is welcome to contribute to test suites repository. Any simple editorial contribution can simply be done with a GitHub Pull Request. You can even do an inline edit of the file on GitHub. For more important contributions that require discussions, you are invited to start a thread in the sysapps mailing list at the W3C.

Since we want to push test suites to offcial w3c test set use of testharness.js is required.
